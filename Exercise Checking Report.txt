Comments..............: Graphics and animation - we added picturs to describe the board state instead of "X/O/U/K". In addition we have added
                        animation - after clicking the required move (and after checking if it is valid) the instrument looks like it is hoovers to the 
						destenation going out of its origin. We did it by using a pictureBox that gets the originl image of the first button that was clicked, 
						update the pictureBox image field to this image. Also the location of the pictureBox is set to the location of the first button, start a timer for the movement animation, and every timer
						Tick we calculte if the picture box arrived to its required location, and if it is we stop the timer, making the pictureBox unvisiable and update the display. 

						Computer movement logic: first it check which instrument will gain most points (by eating rival's instruments),
						afterwards it checks if there is a soldier that may become a king. if it finds an instrument that gains at least one point 
						it moves with it (it will be the instrument that would gain most points for this turn),
						if all of its instruments gain 0 points it will move with the instrument that might become a king (if exists),
						else it moves randommly (of its current valid moves).
